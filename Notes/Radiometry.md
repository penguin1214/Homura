> All of the basic radiometric quantities are effectively different ways of measuring photons. i.e. Photons of different wavelengths carry different amount of energy.

This implies that all four quantities are **wavelength dependent**!

### Solid Angle and Intensity

### Flux
"Energy per time unit".

Flux = Radiant flux = power

### Irradiance and Radiant Exitance
"Flux per differential area".
- Lambert's Law

### Radiance
how to understand "directional"?
So does that mean "direction is represented by solid angle"?
But solid angle can only measure the size of the cone, but it doesn't provide any info about where the solid angle pointing to, i.e. direction?
> "directional" here can be understood as: for a given point `P`, how to represent direction vectors originated at `P`? We can use points on the unit sphere centered at `P` and `P` to form a vector. So a set of points on the unit sphere can represent a set of directions, meanwhile, the point set occupies an area on the sphere and can be considered a solid angle.

Note that radiance is considered when measured area is perpendicular to the direction. This is where the **cosine term** comes from.
